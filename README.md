# Satellite-Earth-Interactive-Graphics-project
The drawn satellite revolves around the earth. It has two types of interaction: on mouse clicks the texture of the satellite changes and with keyboard arrows the camera moves around the satellite.


# How to run the project:
Please ensure node.js is installed in you device. "npm" is needed to run the html file.
Open the project in a platform. For my case I did it in vscode. Open your terminal and install three.js and vite by the two prompts:

npm install --save three

npm install --save-dev vite

After successful installment, run "npx vite" in the terminal. It will provide a localhost server link; ctrl+left click on the link to run the html file.

Thank you so much!!
